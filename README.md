things to include:

- tikz basics
    - color, fill, opacity
    - line thickness, arrows
    - shapes
- tikz coordinate system
    - really don't remember how this works but I remember I was able to define point that I could reference in my triangle animation
- graphing
    - coordinate systems (cartesian, polar)
    - 2D curves
    - 3D surfaces (also look into viewing surfaces from different angles, I know this is something you can do but don't remember how, check matroid example diagrams in thesis on overleaf)
    - plots representing data? (bar charts, histograms, etc)
- animation
    - using LaTex to draw individual frames
    - animate package? need to look into this
- a bunch of cool examples
    - triangle counting
